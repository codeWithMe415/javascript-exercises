**Challenge 13.4**: Storing Data: Local Storage
**Instructions**:
- Local Storage allows you to save data in the browser that persists even after the browser is closed.
- Save a simple key-value pair (e.g., `username: "JohnDoe"`) to local storage using `localStorage.setItem()`.
- Retrieve this value using `localStorage.getItem()` and print it to the console.
- (Bonus) Try storing a JavaScript object in local storage (remember to `stringify` it before saving and `parse` it after retrieving!).
- **Concepts:** This challenge introduces the **Web Storage API**, specifically **`localStorage`**. This is a powerful tool for storing data on the client-side, which can be used to save user preferences, cache data, and more.

**Challenge 13.5**: Basic Regular Expressions: `test()`
**Instructions**:
- Regular expressions are powerful for pattern matching in strings.
- Create a regular expression that matches if a string contains only digits.
- Use the `test()` method of your regular expression to check if a few different strings (e.g., "123", "abc", "1a2b") match the pattern. Print the boolean results.
- **Concepts:** This challenge provides a basic introduction to **regular expressions (regex)**, which are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. The **`test()`** method is a simple way to check if a string matches a regex pattern.
